# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents in `trajectonomics/internal-skills`.

## Rules

1. Pi (`pi.dev`) model restriction: When running the Pi coding agent (`pi.dev`), strictly use **DeepSeek 4.1 Flash** only (e.g., `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-fast`), whether routed via Command Code GOAT (`command-code`) or OpenCode Go (`opencode`). Do not switch to or run any other models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) in Pi sessions for this repository. This rule is mechanically enforced via `.pi/settings.json`.

## Factory Runs

A Factory Run or Spec drafter (a thread titled `traj/trajectonomics/<repo>#<n>` or `triage/trajectonomics/<repo>#<n>`) takes its instructions from the Dispatcher runbook in `trajectonomics/factory`, never from this repository, where `docs/dispatcher-runbook.md` does not exist. Read it with `gh api repos/trajectonomics/factory/contents/docs/dispatcher-runbook.md -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"`. If you cannot read it, stop and say so; do not build from the issue alone.
